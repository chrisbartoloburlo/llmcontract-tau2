# llmcontract on tau2-bench

A standalone case study applying [`llmcontract`](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/llmcontract)'s
session-type runtime monitor to the agent trajectories shipped with
[tau2-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench).

## What this shows

tau2-bench's reward function is outcome-based — it hashes the final
database state and compares. Trajectories that reach the right end-state
pass, even if the agent took the wrong steps to get there.

This repo replays tau2's own published trajectories against the *procedural*
constraints documented in each domain's `policy.md` (encoded as
`llmcontract` session types), and counts how many passing runs violate the
written policy.

**Headline:** across 4 frontier models on the retail and airline domains,
**0.6% of trajectories that tau2 scored as passing violate the explicit
"obtain user confirmation before mutating the database" invariant** —
agent acted first, asked second (or didn't ask at all). See
[`reports/findings.md`](reports/findings.md) for per-model numbers and
sample trajectories.

## Reproduce

```bash
# Clone tau2-bench (provides the trajectory corpus and policy.md files)
git clone https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench /tmp/tau2-bench

# Clone llmcontract (no install — we use it via PYTHONPATH)
git clone https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/llmcontract /tmp/llmcontract

# Run the sweep
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/llmcontract:. python3 src/sweep.py /tmp/tau2-bench/data/tau2/results/final/ retail
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/llmcontract:. python3 src/sweep.py /tmp/tau2-bench/data/tau2/results/final/ airline
```

The model trajectories ship with tau2-bench under
`data/tau2/results/final/`. We don't re-run any models — the analysis is
purely offline replay.

## Notes

This work surfaced a real bug in `llmcontract`'s FSM compiler
(`rec X.!{a.X, b.X, c.X}` only allowed the first-taken branch on
subsequent loops); fix lives in
[`chrisbartoloburlo/llmcontract@b887e7e`](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/llmcontract/commit/b887e7e).
The numbers in `reports/findings.md` were produced after the fix.
